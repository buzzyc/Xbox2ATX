# Xbox2ATX
PCB Design to allow standard ATX power supplies to power original Xboxes v1.0-1.5<p>
Heavily inspired by N64_Freak - this PCB allows people to use their preferred fabrication service with the gerbers provided.<p>
The gerbers have been uploaded alone with a handy dandy ZIP for your convenience.<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> I have a sneaking suspicion that PWR_ON and PWR_OK are reversed on the v1.0-1.1 board, however this exact pinout has been tested by others without issue. Your milage may vary. If this can be confirmed, I will swap the traces around.<p><p>
